# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Structure

This is a client-server application project with the following structure:
- `client/` - Client-side application code
- `server/` - Server-side application code

## Current State

This repository is currently in initial setup phase with empty client and server directories. The project structure suggests it will be a distributed application with separate client and server components.

## Development Notes

Since this is a new project without existing code or configuration files:
- No build tools or package managers have been configured yet
- No testing frameworks are set up
- Project language and technology stack have not been determined
- No development commands are available yet

## Commit Guidelines

- Do not include Claude Code references or co-author information in commit messages
- Keep commit messages concise and focused on the actual changes made
- Use conventional commit format when possible

When code is added to this repository, this file should be updated to include:
- Build and run commands for both client and server
- Testing commands and frameworks used
- Development setup instructions
- Architecture patterns and conventions established
